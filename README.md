==============

**NOTE:** Currently a work in progress!

Graceland lets you easily build a dropwizard application using Guice to inject everything, everywhere.

Graceland introduces the concept of Plugins (which are pretty much Guice `Module`s) so you can compose an application
easily and modularly.
